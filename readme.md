* Finally! A Development Server to build Visualforce Apps from your own computer.
* Finally!! Simply Upload apps and assets as Static Resource, painless and wonderfull; No need to think.
* Finally!!! The technology to build Enterprise Apps with Javascript in a Modular, maintanable way.
* Finally!!!! Forget about Limits and reuse over 80,000 JS Libs and hundreds of Third Party Services.
