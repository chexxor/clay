### Clay is an innovation on how we build Salesforce Apps using Javascript

Let us know how close we got @rodriguezartav

* Finally! A Development Server to build Visualforce Apps locally ( read localhost ).
* Finally!! Simply Upload apps and assets as Static Resource, painless and wonderfull; No need to think.
* Finally!!! The technology to build Enterprise Apps with Javascript in a Modular, maintanable way.
* Finally!!!! Forget about Limits and reuse over 80,000 JS Libs and hundreds of Third Party Services.

**Clay is Open** as a developer you can use Clay free to build robust JS Apps, you are free to choose your favorite framework, patterns and tools.

**Clay is an automated Production Line of Apps**, organizations can use it to automate the production of apps. Just like a production line of cars, Clay has robots that improve manual processes and let's your org reach farther.

## Clay on AppExchange - NO APEX
ClaySF is an Add-ON published on AppExchange that you install on Salesforce and makes it super simple to interact with the Salesforce API's without having to write any APEX whatsoever. 

ClaySF uses a Model to CRUD and Query Salesforce Data the right way, without consuming API Calls and without refresing the page. It's state of the art.

**Query Salesforce Data from Javascript**<br/>
Account.query("select id, name from Account where LastModifiedDate > LAST_WEEK")

**Using Javascript constructs create any Object:**<br/>
var account = Account.create({ Name: "ACME Supplies" });

**No Apex Required**, but it's just as simple to execute Apex Methods from Javascript
var result = Clay.call( "AccountCustomController", "functionName" ,"arg1" ,10, "arg3");

**Finally contact every Salesforce API from Javascript**<br/>
Clay.call("v30/services/chatter/feeds/")


##### Purchasing ClaySF is not required in order to use Clay. Organizations that install CLAYSF do it because of it's commercial advantages when building Apps or by developers that don't want to write their own controllers in Salesforce.
