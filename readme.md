### Clay is the way to build Salesforce Apps using Javascript

**When I imagined Clay, I taught of the perfect developer experience**<br/>
Let us know how close we got @rodriguezartav

* Finally! A Development Server to build Visualforce Apps locally ( read localhost ).
* Finally!! Simply Upload apps and assets as Static Resource, painless and wonderfull; No need to think.
* Finally!!! The technology to build Enterprise Apps with Javascript in a Modular, maintanable way.
* Finally!!!! Forget about Limits and reuse over 80,000 JS Libs and hundreds of Third Party Services.

**Build Single Page Apps, apps without page refresh, no click a wait!**

**Clay is awesome** to build standard HTML, CSS and JS **browser apps** writting Enterprise Modular Code 

**Clay is Open** as a developer you can use Clay free to build robust JS Apps, you are free to choose your favorite framework, patterns and tools.

**Clay is an automated Production Line of Apps**, organizations can use it to automate the production of apps. Just like a production line of cars, Clay has robots that improve manual processes and let's your org reach farther.

## The next generation of Javascript Apps
Internet Users got used to the experience of Facebook, Twitter, Gmail and hundreds of the leading web apps. Business users however must conform with them old click and wait Apps where it takes ages ( and hundreds of page refreshes ) to get anything done.

There is a new generation of Apps that are amazing, reactive, beautifull and with Clay posible. Give it a try and learn how simple it is to build modern Javascript Applications the modular, profesional way.


## Clay on AppExchange - NO APEX
ClaySF is an Add-ON published on AppExchange that you install on Salesforce and makes it super simple to interact with the Salesforce API's without having to write any APEX whatsoever. 

ClaySF uses a Model to CRUD and Query Salesforce Data the right way, without consuming API Calls and without refresing the page. It's state of the art.

##### Purchasing ClaySF is not required in order to use Clay. Organizations that install CLAYSF do it because of it's commercial advantages when building Apps or by developers that don't want to write their own controllers in Salesforce.

##The Production Line of Apps
Clay was build as a full-fledged profesional production line and it has a command line tool to automated everything.

Clay introduces the concept of version, each deployment is versioned so it's super simple to go back to old builds.

In the same way Clay introduces App Downloads, so you can download any version of an App and use it as a template for a new app. Your organization can set base proyects or templates that are already structured a standard way.

Dependency Managment is automated, so there is no worries about one developer working in one version of Jquery crasing with another one, integration is done automatically with every build.

Onbording new developers is simple, no enviroment to setup, everything is standard. Training is simple as well, you may create apps specifically for that and have new-comers download them. That's how with Clay junior developers can build enterprise apps.

## On the Shoulders of Giants ##

Clay is built on top of lessons and/or code from the leading open source libraries and minds in the world. Special Recognition to Alex Maccaw for his vision and work on modular code with Spine and Hem Server Specially and to Substack's Unix Mentality and it's Browserify Open Source Library. The Amazing work by Visionmedia is all over the place in Express and SuperAgent. PLV8 powers ours backend thanks to mgutz concepts. Finally thanks to creationix for it's pair programming sessions.

Lessons learned while using Grunt and Yeoman definitely shaped 3VOT, but those projects are not used on the CLI.
